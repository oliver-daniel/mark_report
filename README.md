# "Classic Devine" Markbook
Class management and custom student reporting software designed for a teacher.

Makes use of [LGoodDatePicker](https://github.com/LGoodDatePicker/LGoodDatePicker) for date selection, [Apache Derby](https://db.apache.org/derby/) for DB management, and [JFreeChart](http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart/) for report charts.
<p>I take no credit for these libraries. However, the remainder of the code is mine. Please do not steal my work, and give credit when it is due.
<p>Cheers!
